maybe we even know a baker 6.333134513676991e-155
this is a person going for a walk 1.2882297539194154e-231
when i asked my daughter who her favorite character was in star wars do you know what she said 2.8744291130001147e-232

i don't know if you've heard of this 4.945616869342108e-155
but there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring this room down 3.25715490284633e-232
at that point i also had a son 1.1368587676511996e-231
by using this method the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 5.3701405702879534e-232
the other end of the spectrum i met this guy 8.853864984883467e-232
it was a little while later that i started my research with sanitation and i met that man again 2.477426605014895e-232
everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory 3.690840039559348e-232
fiction alone domesticates it invites it to the table 8.853864984883467e-232
but i don't think that explanation is good enough 4.364491568564534e-155
so try to meet that bar 1.2882297539194154e-231
how to do it 1.2882297539194154e-231
but instead i remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head and it became clear to me that casting directors didn't hire fluffy ethnic disabled actors 6.029293985736373e-233
that weak tie helped her get a job there 7.813508425061864e-232
books banned in china of course 1.1368587676511996e-231
by that i simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age 3.25715490284633e-232
so i took the job as a sanitation worker 1.0032743411283238e-231
he lives in a small village in southern somalia 6.895396983435736e-232
at the most basic level we remember when we pay attention 6.085166479973199e-232
and this gap has become shorter shorter and even shorter and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter the thickness of a touch-screen glass and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone 3.3528323128761053e-233
he was only three at the time 1.1368587676511996e-231
i went to teach seventh graders math in the new york city public schools 3.418291552750845e-232
thank you 1.4256605770826504e-231
behind the lean-to was a dump maybe 40 feet square with rotting apple cores and balled-up aluminum foil and a dead sneaker 8.043026600173053e-233
the weight takes a long time to get used to 1.1368587676511996e-231

finding it randomly would be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack blindfolded wearing baseball mitts 1.7027087446182536e-232
my first gig was driving famous comics from new york city to shows in new jersey and i'll never forget the face of the first comic i ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the new jersey turnpike with a chick with c p driving him 2.781209768388599e-157
you're in and out of traffic all day and it's zooming around you 2.1863213053063146e-232
my big break came in 2010 1.0032743411283238e-231
these young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities 7.813508425061864e-232
sometimes we can't solve big problems because our political systems fail 4.973584861914399e-232
it's true 1.2882297539194154e-231
it's christmas eve you're at the mall you're driving around in circles looking for parking and what do you see 1.3260709036512249e-232
it is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions 5.244712163973215e-232
i believe he is selling hope 1.2882297539194154e-231
what we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies 1.1702534650797613e-232
it's actually not that singular there are contests held all over the world 3.6046344406433896e-232
so i specialize in twentysomethings because i believe that every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists sociologists neurologists and fertility specialists already know that claiming your 20s is one of the simplest yet most transformative things you can do for work for love for your happiness maybe even for the world 5.434035517213124e-235
but i didn't handle it 8.15394372921771e-155
it's so mysterious and it's so pervasive 1.1103055738259992e-231
one commenter even suggested that i add my disability to my credits screenwriter comedian palsy 2.2386076440877334e-232
thank you 1.2882297539194154e-231
but there actually are no shortcuts 1.2882297539194154e-231
but what we hear less about is that there's such a thing as adult development and our 20s are that critical period of adult development 1.0327450581717792e-232
he started a motorbike company 1.1368587676511996e-231
thank you 1.2882297539194154e-231
what makes his story different 1.0032743411283238e-231
and i went back and i read a whole host of memory treatises treatises written 2 000-plus years ago in latin in antiquity and then later in the middle ages 6.28089107352405e-233
remember fire 1.2882297539194154e-231

armstrong and aldrin were alone but their presence on the moon's gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive collective effort 2.1863213053063146e-232
i want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in new york city 3.6046344406433896e-232
and i said to him ed when did you realize that you were a savant 1.5575517787321263e-78
that's the work that stands before us 1.2882297539194154e-231
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education 8.647068503442337e-232
he was waiting 1.2882297539194154e-231
its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from where passion comes from where happiness comes from 1.5385710332010157e-232
jealousy makes us all amateur novelists and this is something proust understood 3.6046344406433896e-232
thank you very much 1.2882297539194154e-231
having little need to remember anymore it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how 3.690840039559348e-232
so after we know the characters we start building phrases 8.853864984883467e-232
and while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competitions everything all of the techniques that are being used ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding 2.455622738595633e-156
i'd like you to notice the color of the door the material that it's made out of 3.6046344406433896e-232
also during our first visit to ethiopia i was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open-air structure where thousands of people they go and buy things every day from small vendors 1.8375610538439091e-233
it was a beautiful day 1.2882297539194154e-231
i recommend it to all of you it's on demand now 5.9430374753870144e-232
so in a frenzy i corrected everybody's marks not imaginatively 4.182269681343779e-232
it's a standard practice in the academic world 1.0032743411283238e-231
but then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell 6.413718283190248e-233
now alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems 1.397668449588898e-233
two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff 9.798412298238562e-232
but that's what we're looking for trustworthiness before trust 8.853864984883467e-232
we could go to mars if we want 8.853864984883467e-232
who cleans up after us in rio or in paris or in london 6.085166479973199e-232
they only hired perfect people 1.258141043412406e-231
the definition of manhood is already turning upside down 6.085166479973199e-232

there's no public park in mogadishu 9.798412298238562e-232
this is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit 6.895396983435736e-232
so let's do what characters always do when they're not sure when they are in possession of a mystery 2.8744291130001147e-232
i have to tell you it's very boring but before i did yoga i was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up 1.934650651088764e-232
i don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that 2.9996682624479974e-155
i toured the world as a headliner on arabs gone wild 3.873431785131019e-232
people with disabilities are the largest minority in the world and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment 2.1863213053063146e-232
if they're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day it starts to spill out of its containments and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways 1.4249559205297017e-232
and they crash straight into the front door of your home 3.841240254629353e-155
this is really what brought me to using satellite imagery 7.813508425061864e-232
what happened 1.2882297539194154e-231
no shakespeare 1.4256605770826504e-231
she is scantily clad she's dancing on your coffee table and she's singing hit me baby one more time 2.8072921250592275e-232
it's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy 5.527885951329542e-233
first the claim why do people think trust has declined 6.895396983435736e-232
who are these guys what are they learning 1.1368587676511996e-231
and i tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days but i started to cry 3.25715490284633e-232
diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us 2.477426605014895e-232
the aim i think is more trustworthiness and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy 2.4762020955350534e-233
here's a story about how that can go 8.853864984883467e-232
in your living room in full imaginative broadband picture britney spears 6.895396983435736e-232
but he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing unintentional behaviors 4.182269681343779e-232
that small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber and that dynamic group of people were al shabaab a terrorist organization linked to al qaeda 4.305121907624865e-233
bakers smell good when they come home from work 8.853864984883467e-232
he empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs that they could be change makers 3.25715490284633e-232
walk past him walk past him into your living room 1.0032743411283238e-231
everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure maybe right about now 1.057443375777407e-232
one's a claim there has been a great decline in trust very widely believed 2.1863213053063146e-232
i grew up watching whoopi goldberg roseanne barr ellen and all of these women had one thing in common they were comedians 2.1863213053063146e-232
there is no galvanizing contest like the cold war no politician like john kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system 1.5018924905866813e-233
it's not what i would aim at 1.3519605352440902e-231
simple 1.2882297539194154e-231
so because of books i'm here today happy living again with a purpose and a clarity most of the time 1.934650651088764e-232
my crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places 7.813508425061864e-232
so they're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions 4.182269681343779e-232
so i thought well if comparative reading works for research why not do it in daily life too 1.8296796196198142e-232
we don't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office-holder or type of person is going to be uniform 1.2575191861870427e-232
why is there so much force capital f force in the movies we have for our kids and so little yellow brick road 8.043026600173053e-233
but now you don't have to worry about it 1.1103055738259992e-231
making ideas actually started in 1984 bc at a not-lost-for-long city found from above 1.7027087446182536e-232
hello tedwomen what is up 1.2882297539194154e-231
he is introduced to this young woman 1.1368587676511996e-231
but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy 4.739132419722992e-232
thank you 1.2882297539194154e-231
and it wasn't social intelligence 7.711523862191631e-155
let's look at why they go so well together the novel and jealousy jealousy and proust 5.244712163973215e-232
grit is sticking with your future day in day out not just for the week not just for the month but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality 5.242119877384047e-233
and of course the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic every single one of them about the journey of a boy or a man or two men who are friends or a man and his son or two men who are raising a little girl 2.932823126137274e-157
but our two hands still remain outside the screen 8.853864984883467e-232
this was before 9 11 and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use i hate moslems as a campaign slogan 9.138642588129591e-233

so how does this work 1.2882297539194154e-231
so if my three older sisters were mopping i was mopping 5.9430374753870144e-232
here's what it said 1.2882297539194154e-231
and for that i thought what would be the best orientation in the mediterranean climate for an apartment 1.2504477702495943e-155
so why did they go 1.2882297539194154e-231
i want more quests like that 1.258141043412406e-231
they're covered in sand they're difficult to see 7.813508425061864e-232
and then there's the stigma 6.333134513676991e-155
yo is she retarded 1.1368587676511996e-231
they wanted to know do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally anatomically different from the rest of ours 1.9755643120096232e-232
does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement 3.6046344406433896e-232
i don't have an overview 1.5319719891192393e-231
cookie monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse 6.895396983435736e-232
i think these people are experts 1.1103055738259992e-231
but kennedy's own words at rice university in 1962 provide a better clue 3.25715490284633e-232
i didn't want to be the only one left standing up so sometimes i think i married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30 3.5825928439963765e-156

no one put a curse on my mother's uterus and i didn't get it because my parents are first cousins which they are 4.6001402693349683e-156
no the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound 3.6046344406433896e-232
my parents wanted me to become an engineer like them 9.798412298238562e-232
but the common noun baker we know bakers 7.813508425061864e-232
sometimes big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so 6.386209374751479e-232
in education the one thing we know how to measure best is i q but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily 3.7992567487280285e-233
so a sun origin together we build japan 7.813508425061864e-232
thanks 1.2882297539194154e-231
they are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy but they are not necessarily showing boys how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy 5.940100029848595e-233

use your magic slippers to defeat the computer-generated armies of the wicked witch 4.739132419722992e-232

because she's blameless everybody knows it 8.853864984883467e-232
does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity 4.739132419722992e-232
he starts this new life 1.2882297539194154e-231

no jealousy no proust and now i mean i know it's fashionable to say that proust has the answers to everything but in the case of jealousy he kind of does 4.082567065460873e-233
do you remember what it was 1.2882297539194154e-231
and i had this notion that i might enter it sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism 2.209388577619722e-155
he says you know look i know you think this is repugnant but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument 8.642794545403028e-233
this grew into a passion for finding things a love for the past and archaeology 4.084585940286461e-232
when i was in my 20s i saw my very first psychotherapy client 6.085166479973199e-232
how can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands 2.8072921250592275e-232
the poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause 1.1368587676511996e-231
and it's very simple there's just three questions you should ask is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines 3.572910002197882e-156
but the one moment that stands out the most was when i got before this moment but the one moment that stands out the most was when i got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee has parkinson's and shakes just like me muhammad ali 5.826348927365575e-234

and does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way 6.085166479973199e-232

now if somebody said to you do you trust greengrocers 6.895396983435736e-232
and the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day 5.198553378401417e-156
and i operated the mechanical brooms and i plowed the snow 1.1103055738259992e-231

i was like this is unbelievable 1.4256605770826504e-231
and i think if there's one thing that i want to leave you with it's what e p the amnesic who couldn't even remember that he had a memory problem left me with which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories 2.4587465287212665e-80
it's there but it's not as prevalent as you think and on days when it is really bad you get used to it rather quickly 1.1097567867507661e-232
and i'm a journalist i need something to write about 3.076833869215792e-78
and now i can stand on my head 1.4256605770826504e-231
great memories are learned 1.2882297539194154e-231
so growth mindset is a great idea for building grit 5.3701405702879534e-232

as a culture we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood 4.182269681343779e-232
so we used to solve big problems 8.853864984883467e-232
we use them we throw them out we forget about them because we know there's a workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away 9.331905037821599e-233

architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly 5.3701405702879534e-232
that's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric in these sorts of spatial terms 2.1863213053063146e-232
the rest of us are in between and by the way the average person in the street is almost exactly midway 1.5026351931293137e-232
god knows we don't lack for the challenges 1.052907923529733e-231
but there were exceptions to the rule 8.853864984883467e-232

i would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy 1.7027087446182536e-232
the second example is a master plan of 2 000 apartments and facilities in the city of tunis 3.6046344406433896e-232
i have friends who are very confident they can do certain things but i realize that they overestimate their own competence 2.477426605014895e-232
and it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters 2.8072921250592275e-232
so in the flow of your days in the flow of your lives next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you take a moment to acknowledge them 3.4330160103787776e-233
jealousy likes information 1.2882297539194154e-231
they went because it was a big thing to do 6.085166479973199e-232

he wants to create a space where families young people can come together and as he says smell the proverbial roses 1.1702534650797613e-232
no i think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves 5.244712163973215e-232
i said excuse me if i can't do the stunts neither can the character 1.8193907701416327e-155
in short in our real lives we seek to place trust in a differentiated way 6.085166479973199e-232
when i went to the site the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in barcelona and other cities in europe with these courtyards 8.500261724136897e-234
some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well 6.386209374751479e-232
it never stops coming 1.4256605770826504e-231
the second is an aim we should have more trust 6.895396983435736e-232
i can't give the world d's as much as i would really like to some days 1.8193907701416327e-155
easy to remember since a talking tree is pretty idiotic 6.895396983435736e-232
in other words we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier 3.25715490284633e-232
jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive 7.813508425061864e-232
but to an outsider it seems to be as impenetrable as the great wall of china 4.182269681343779e-232

people say children are cruel but i was never made fun of as a child or an adult 2.477426605014895e-232
do you trust politicians do you trust teachers 1.0032743411283238e-231
but i wondered what if there could be no boundary at all 7.651691757104309e-232
the volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood and in the courtyards there are the different facilities such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by a series of commercial spaces that bring activity to the ground floor 3.1186198499117845e-234
the aim is to have more trust 1.2882297539194154e-231
on july 21st 1969 buzz aldrin climbed out of apollo 11's lunar module and descended onto the sea of tranquility 1.929421779987532e-232
who cleans up after us 1.2882297539194154e-231
it wasn't good looks physical health and it wasn't i q 5.635809992474887e-232
and we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids and as three-dimensional and delightful as hermione and katniss are these are still war movies 2.782585107555365e-156

i was invited to be a guest on the cable news show countdown with keith olbermann 3.25715490284633e-232
i rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city and i learned a lot but i was still an outsider 6.731015159885145e-233
people died including the crew of apollo 1 1.0032743411283238e-231
so so much for the aim 1.2882297539194154e-231
but there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see us energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus 1.1982403254679314e-232
but i think if the wizard of oz were made today the wizard would say dorothy you are the savior of oz that the prophecy foretold 1.3260709036512249e-232
with the funny stories that alex would bring to session it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road 1.5385710332010157e-232
yes people settle down later than they used to but that didn't make alex's 20s a developmental downtime 1.8296796196198142e-232
he eventually gets married 1.2882297539194154e-231
at first the first thing i thought was i want to run away 7.631011170724675e-232
thank you 1.2882297539194154e-231
my father's mantra was you can do it yes you can can 3.690840039559348e-232
that's what psychologists call an aha moment 8.853864984883467e-232
thank you very much 1.2882297539194154e-231
it was fun because this is actually not about training your memory 5.635809992474887e-232
the movies are very very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys 8.642794545403028e-233
it certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective 6.085166479973199e-232
maybe it was a poem 1.2882297539194154e-231
having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered 3.1810787288175467e-232
i love sharing my favorite movies with my kids and when my daughter was four we got to watch the wizard of oz together 1.929421779987532e-232
the next challenge was when we looked at the site that is in a really growing area of the city where most of these buildings that you see in the image they were not there 5.527885951329542e-233
no one has traveled faster than the crew of apollo 10 and blithe optimism about technology's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve such as going to mars creating clean energy curing cancer or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard 2.4287835812133248e-234
and five meters down underneath a thick layer of mud we found a dense layer of pottery 2.8744291130001147e-232

i don't understand why i was never caught 4.945616869342108e-155
it totally dominated her imagination for months 7.813508425061864e-232
what opinion polls record is of course opinions 6.895396983435736e-232
trust is the response 1.2882297539194154e-231
and i wonder what he's soaking in 3.297337141451012e-78
in a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year 1.0355438711869664e-232
apollo employed around 400 000 people and demanded the collaboration of 20 000 companies universities and government agencies 2.477426605014895e-232
but i've always preferred inspector lestrade who is the rat-faced head of scotland yard who needs holmes desperately needs holmes' genius but resents him 4.995008821347951e-233
people who are over 40 don't panic 7.631011170724675e-232
what immense if misplaced creativity right 1.1368587676511996e-231
it's one tragedy compounding another 1.2882297539194154e-231
one fun fact i learned while on the air with keith olbermann was that humans on the internet are scumbags 1.7434293862051595e-232
as a result i have cerebral palsy which means i shake all the time 4.6284422396541125e-232

is he picking up on the fact that luke joins an army to overthrow the government 6.895396983435736e-232

my name is maysoon zayid and if i can can you can can 5.635809992474887e-232
they were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers 8.853864984883467e-232
and she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend and i have to confess when i heard this i just reacted with admiration 4.929812271544002e-156
first i told emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital 4.182269681343779e-232
we know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn 2.8744291130001147e-232
i learned how to dance in heels which means i can walk in heels 3.1810787288175467e-232
hollywood has a sordid history of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen 3.690840039559348e-232
for young people the promise of the city the big city dream is that of opportunity of jobs of wealth but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities 3.6028527898631017e-233
however you configure or wherever you place the us who cleans up after us in istanbul 2.5366747889215876e-232
in fact the phrase topic sentence that comes from the greek word topos which means place 1.7434293862051595e-232
nasa even has the outline of a plan 1.0032743411283238e-231
and i had this notion that i might write something longer about this subculture of competitive memorizers 1.340061911545247e-155
his name is paulie and we worked together many times and we became good friends 4.6284422396541125e-232
the answer was no 1.2882297539194154e-231
so i started a research project with them 8.853864984883467e-232
maybe it was names from an old yearbook that i bought at a flea market 4.182269681343779e-232
often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates 4.739132419722992e-232
so inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality 1.4249559205297017e-232
and we think about proust we think about the sentimental bits right 7.813508425061864e-232
grief humiliation loss these were the avenues to wisdom for proust 5.3701405702879534e-232
we've heard it over the last two days here at ted 6.085166479973199e-232
second i told emma that the urban tribe is overrated 6.895396983435736e-232
until as many of you are thinking this year when they finally came out with brave 4.739132419722992e-232
and you're like god can't i just be a little disabled 2.061639836710053e-155
even a shattered dream can do that for you 8.853864984883467e-232
picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you 6.263915414478913e-233
jealousy likes details 1.2882297539194154e-231
you have to give them the basis for giving you their trust 6.085166479973199e-232
in fact the more intensely jealous we are the more we become residents of fantasy 6.085166479973199e-232
i might trust my most loquacious friend to keep a conversation going but not but perhaps not to keep a secret 2.6621681380487264e-232
everyone asks about the smell 1.0032743411283238e-231
they don't work as they're supposed to 1.1931009847695213e-231
how is this story different 1.0032743411283238e-231
oh yay y'all's awesome 1.2882297539194154e-231
it has not yet caught on and caught fire but maybe today we will start a movement 5.244712163973215e-232
we tell ourselves a story about other people's lives and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible 1.1702534650797613e-232
only my friends supported me but they were kids just as powerless as i was 4.739132419722992e-232
i won the contest which really wasn't supposed to happen 6.734343721752972e-232
we often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift but that is not the case 1.7027087446182536e-232
so i started reading books in pairs 8.853864984883467e-232
of note they were using or they seemed to be using a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation 3.1810787288175467e-232
so as it turns out ted was not founded in 1984 ad 5.9430374753870144e-232
but going to mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal and that will never happen 2.8072921250592275e-232
do you remember what the critics said when brave came out 4.739132419722992e-232
finally big problems sometimes elude solution because we don't really understand the problem 3.873431785131019e-232
the person inside the mouth the person is trapped 6.895396983435736e-232
i mean it should have been so blatantly obvious 8.647068503442337e-232
once upon a time people invested in their memories in laboriously furnishing their minds 4.739132419722992e-232
that's one way to go 1.2882297539194154e-231
why are you still standing there 1.2882297539194154e-231
i don't know what i'm supposed to do 7.1958300848837144e-155
i started to imagine what this would look like 8.853864984883467e-232
when you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself 9.11394314996143e-233
and she looked at me and she went five four three two 6.734343721752972e-232
we studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year and of those who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students 1.233438077602416e-233
i was a girl with c p 1.052907923529733e-231

they are pedaling really hard they're sweaty they're bouncing around a lot 6.386209374751479e-232
and these porches on the roof all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside 1.6012671706151799e-155
what simonides figured out at that moment is something that i think we all kind of intuitively know which is that as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories 4.302994029213821e-234
simonides standing outside the sole survivor amid the wreckage closes his eyes and has this realization which is that in his mind's eye he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting 2.304365702223686e-233
they are competing in a naked bicycle race and they are headed straight for your front door 3.6046344406433896e-232
well the name baker doesn't actually mean anything to you 4.127681278534973e-155
i started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them 5.244712163973215e-232
but not only did mr olbermann invite me back he made me a full-time contributor and he taped down my chair 1.7027087446182536e-232
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life 7.631011170724675e-232
i have cerebral palsy 1.2882297539194154e-231
it was just three days away 1.2882297539194154e-231
i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings and in every study my question was who is successful here and why 7.097946062058228e-233
so i looked at the stage manager and i'm like excuse me can i have another chair 1.043641266075602e-155
and this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night 7.563850534008507e-156
step over the threshold of your door into your foyer your hallway whatever's on the other side and appreciate the quality of the light 1.1097567867507661e-232
it's a hungry emotion it must be fed 1.0032743411283238e-231
a japanese person 1.2882297539194154e-231
and it's where all the neighbors they can go up and socialize and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning jumping from one building to another 4.0486374419375214e-156
this is a guy called ed cook who had come over from england where he had one of the best trained memories 2.2386076440877334e-232
i was like the pet lemur of the theater department 1.1368587676511996e-231
i remember him telling me because he was a college graduate unemployed frustrated that he was the perfect target for al shabaab and other terrorist organizations to be recruited 7.6272394159932085e-233
so it's not just at west point or the national spelling bee that grit matters it's also in school especially for kids at risk for dropping out 4.305121907624865e-233
researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence 8.853864984883467e-232
and this is why i think jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things 1.934650651088764e-232
i vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions but i was absolutely certain there would be mars colonies in my lifetime 8.235377291091144e-233
i think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood 4.6284422396541125e-232
she's married to a man she mindfully chose 7.813508425061864e-232
and i come back to you at some point later on and i say do you remember that word that i told you a while back 9.665740280508462e-156
because windows and files have a position in the real space selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf 1.3260709036512249e-232
by the end of the day they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city 1.1982403254679314e-232
and he looked at me and he just nodded and he said we're going to be okay 3.1810787288175467e-232
you only need 1 000 to understand the basic literacy 6.895396983435736e-232
some people say i'm the first stand-up comic in the arab world 5.635809992474887e-232
and the site visibly appears brown but when we use the infrared and we process it all of the sudden using false color the site appears as bright pink 1.5026351931293137e-232
we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep 8.853864984883467e-232
too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves and at me sitting across the room and say about their 20s what was i doing what was i thinking 2.805904574036379e-233
and that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me 3.841240254629353e-155
we can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness 1.2882297539194154e-231
besides the best time to work on alex's marriage is before she has one 3.6046344406433896e-232
this is my friend ben pridmore three-time world memory champion 6.085166479973199e-232
so what we did is we used nasa topography data to map out the landscape very subtle changes 1.1982403254679314e-232
but the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany you shall honor your father and mother 4.084585940286461e-232
a 52-year-old michigan woman was caught creating a fake facebook account from which she sent vile hideous messages to herself for a year 4.995008821347951e-233
and also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity 3.690840039559348e-232
now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20 or even 25 and i agree with you 5.455734108434667e-156
let's say that you've been invited to ted center stage to give a speech and you want to do it from memory and you want to do it the way that cicero would have done it if he had been invited to tedxrome 2 000 years ago 7.481180109228759e-234
and i think that judgment requires us to look at three things 2.567968747812476e-78
i remember i was talking with a midwife who said well you see the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby 6.263915414478913e-233
and i was astonished i was very angry and i was deeply confused 9.798412298238562e-232
this area is huge it's four miles by three miles in size 6.085166479973199e-232
well every day all over the place it's being done by ordinary people by officials by institutions quite effectively 2.2386076440877334e-232
aden saw an opportunity and seized it 9.798412298238562e-232
and if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters and reliable and honest we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them because they'll be trustworthy 2.455622738595633e-156
her favorite character was glinda of course 1.1368587676511996e-231
so the moral of all this is we need to think much less about trust let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis-detected by opinion polls much more about being trustworthy and how you give people adequate useful and simple evidence that you're trustworthy 2.957401662980227e-234
if you make yourself vulnerable to the other party then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying 1.0327450581717792e-232
so with this tool this boundary has been broken 1.0032743411283238e-231
so the first step is to inspire young people and in that room mohamed's presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room 1.3260709036512249e-232
nowadays exile has turned into getting out 1.2882297539194154e-231
that's just not convenient for propaganda got it 6.805395922591311e-155
during that analysis i paid special attention to the medina that is this 1 000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall opened by twelve different gates connected by almost straight lines 2.6111884307750205e-233
so in these examples we are reaching into the digital world 7.813508425061864e-232
now we live today and are raising our children in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex 2.1863213053063146e-232
nobody can say who was inside nobody can say where they were sitting 4.084585940286461e-232
what else can they record 1.2882297539194154e-231
and then you'd go inside your house and you would see an image of cookie monster on top of mister ed 2.477426605014895e-232
the top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature enough to read road signs restaurant menus to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers 3.4330160103787776e-233
don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do 4.973584861914399e-232
upon graduating i moved back home and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera 1.707323207169105e-232
so how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up 1.9755643120096232e-232
and i started talking to a few of the competitors 5.588971591971542e-155
for example i found this map out of place at first because this is what chinese students grew up with 2.8744291130001147e-232
by 2030 three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 6.895396983435736e-232
so i had to grip onto the anchor's desk so that i wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment and when the interview was over i was livid 1.3296646506992816e-232
so yes half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed 4.739132419722992e-232
so let's look at the numbers 1.2882297539194154e-231
i walked in looking like i was going to the prom and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me on a spinning rolling chair 9.11394314996143e-233
but grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress 2.958864130998708e-233
so in the end i think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern 3.873431785131019e-232
i find the stigma especially ironic because i strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city for three reasons 7.097946062058228e-233
and as hard as her 20s were her early life had been even harder 2.6400432442670582e-155
not good enough 1.4256605770826504e-231
that's a topic for a different day 1.4256605770826504e-231
hopefully by the beginning of next year because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction 3.25715490284633e-232
grit is living life like it's a marathon not a sprint 4.6284422396541125e-232
you hear it all the time 1.2882297539194154e-231
thank god almighty i'm free at last 1.052907923529733e-231
it'd make i thought maybe a nice epilogue to all my research 6.895396983435736e-232
this is how stuff is made memorable 1.2882297539194154e-231
they gave them a bunch of cognitive tests and the answer was not really 3.873431785131019e-232
the moon 1.2882297539194154e-231
and then it starts to sound like this dating in my 20s was like musical chairs 1.4131133182782952e-155
when i was 27 years old i left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding teaching 1.9755643120096232e-232
right thank you 1.4256605770826504e-231
but the question was how we could do a multistory contemporary building with these principles 3.25715490284633e-232
so when we think about child development we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain 9.11394314996143e-233
and then there's what i call our average necessary quotidian velocity 2.9915609182707424e-155
designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3d and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen 2.477426605014895e-232
at 25 emma came to my office because she was in her words having an identity crisis 2.5366747889215876e-232
personal history by katharine graham the snowball warren buffett and the business of life by alice schroeder i also compare the same stories in different genres holy bible king james version lamb by chrisopher moore or similar stories from different cultures as joseph campbell did in his wonderful book the power of myth by joseph campbell for example both the christ and the buddha went through three temptations 4.0024079170385836e-235
now highsmith is a particular favorite of mine 1.2882297539194154e-231
so if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly 6.413718283190248e-233
it's very good don't let that stop you 9.291879812217675e-232
what would such a future look like 1.2882297539194154e-231
the apollo mission which has become a kind of metaphor for technology's capacity to solve big problems met these criteria 1.1982403254679314e-232
and you go into your kitchen and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year and you have some friends to help you remember that 1.489410479645753e-156
one out of five women in america say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life 3.25715490284633e-232
and he was this incredibly tragic figure but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are 1.7434293862051595e-232
i wanted to get to know them as individuals 1.258141043412406e-231
and i think of those people who for example placed their savings with the very aptly named mr madoff who then made off with them and i think of them and i think well yes too much trust 4.150734895784605e-80
i was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the adirondack mountains a wilderness area in the northern part of new york state 6.413718283190248e-233
i might after all know that she wasn't a good driver 9.291879812217675e-232
the shop where i buy my socks says i may take them back and they don't ask any questions 2.5366747889215876e-232
this is how roman orators memorized their speeches not word-for-word which is just going to screw you up but topic-for-topic 1.5026351931293137e-232
but if you want to live a memorable life you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember 1.9755643120096232e-232
twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving lax bound for somewhere west 2.8744291130001147e-232
also i gotta tell you i got 99 problems and palsy is just one 1.1826004862102723e-155
but these concepts are not impossible and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough 1.0355438711869664e-232
for most of human history we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail but in 1969 the crew of apollo 10 flew at 25 000 miles an hour 2.805904574036379e-233
so i'm going to talk about trust and i'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust 1.1826004862102723e-155
and i learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff 4.932250118548181e-155
she often cried in our sessions but then would collect herself by saying you can't pick your family but you can pick your friends 1.1097567867507661e-232
after seeing a few of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that they have three very big points 1.1982403254679314e-232
it's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elected to congress so that's good 2.477426605014895e-232
i haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe 7.236523273960503e-232
v c s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy and v c s have never never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value 5.525153701366141e-234
i never would have expected that 6.005740822548667e-155
knock knock is anyone home 1.2882297539194154e-231
another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it 1.7206735543592568e-155
but you watch that movie enough times and you start to realize how unusual it is 1.9755643120096232e-232
if we do not include young people in the growth of our cities if we do not provide them opportunities the story of waithood the gateway to terrorism to violence to gangs will be the story of cities 2 0 2.310610698186728e-233
i have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials 4.6284422396541125e-232
that question stayed with me and it simplified a little 1.1368587676511996e-231
my dream was coming true 1.2882297539194154e-231
this is an idea developed at stanford university by carol dweck and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort 9.793569269297845e-233
municipal waste what we think of when we talk about garbage accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream 1.9755643120096232e-232
it gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand 3.6046344406433896e-232
when the work came back i calculated grades 7.631011170724675e-232
we can we must but these four elements must all be present political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem institutions must support its solution it must really be a technological problem and we must understand it 5.826348927365575e-234
twentysomethings like alex and i had nothing but time 4.6284422396541125e-232
last year the new york times published a study that the government had done 4.739132419722992e-232
my father taught me how to walk when i was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking 2.1863213053063146e-232
and he began delivering flowers to weddings creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city and he's now working on creating mogadishu's first public park in 22 years 9.033731208024483e-157
we need to measure whether we've been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons learned 1.3260709036512249e-232
maybe a year passes nothing 1.258141043412406e-231
but his story takes a different route 1.1368587676511996e-231
this is a mountain 1.2882297539194154e-231
it's almost as though if you're a boy you are a dopey animal and if you are a girl you should bring your warrior costume 1.929421779987532e-232
but my dream was to become a chinese opera singer 8.853864984883467e-232
that is me playing my imaginary piano 8.853864984883467e-232
so we have gone through almost 30 characters 1.1368587676511996e-231
and also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture 9.71217633369407e-156
we are going to be okay 1.2882297539194154e-231
that was the moment i realized 30 is not the new 20 5.244712163973215e-232
on top of that we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines and this modified this initial pattern 6.263915414478913e-233
so i start shouting from the rooftops i'm finally going to get a part 4.6284422396541125e-232
the problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event 6.085166479973199e-232
so what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say you have 10 extra years to start your life 5.660086518965582e-233
it feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys with things like iphones and apps and social media or algorithms that speed automated trading 1.5837658415519692e-233
secondly what about the aim 1.2882297539194154e-231
and that of course is because you can't fool all of the people all of the time usually 1.8193907701416327e-155
we're going to be okay 1.2882297539194154e-231
we know primates do bluebirds are actually very prone 4.739132419722992e-232
so i want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared 7.631011170724675e-232
that's really bad for the worker 1.2882297539194154e-231

you can all give your own examples there 1.1368587676511996e-231
so i left the classroom and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist 2.061639836710053e-155
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels 1.5026351931293137e-232
well no faithless helen no odyssey 1.4256605770826504e-231
if the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides as if she was yelling frantically help i'm on fire this symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame but i like to think that way whichever works for you 1.233438077602416e-233
i turned to books 1.3519605352440902e-231
so here's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know 2.8744291130001147e-232
president nixon declared war on cancer in 1971 but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy and it is only in the last 10 years that effective viable therapies have come to seem real 3.5338592586310363e-234
in fact i aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy 3.873431785131019e-232
the light is shining down on cookie monster 1.2882297539194154e-231
dr dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge they're much more likely to persevere when they fail because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition 5.842138749916553e-234
the bodies can't be properly buried 1.1931009847695213e-231
and so i started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning before i sat down with my new york times just trying to remember something 2.455622738595633e-156
they need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses 2.477426605014895e-232
the novel is very good on this point 1.2882297539194154e-231
now in that moment it took everything i had not to say i will 1.4830222887862167e-155
these people must be freaks of nature 8.853864984883467e-232
so i became a comic 1.5319719891192393e-231
i got to walk the red carpet flanked by soap diva susan lucci and the iconic lorraine arbus 2.8072921250592275e-232
suddenly my disability on the world wide web is fair game 6.895396983435736e-232
this crowd is going to be fine i think 1.258141043412406e-231
the flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves from our own dross our cast-offs and that flow must be maintained always no matter what 1.1702534650797613e-232
we spent an afternoon together in the salt lake city public library memorizing phone books which was scintillating 1.7434293862051595e-232
second they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside and then you need a lot of cooling 1.0327450581717792e-232
there's nothing wrong with most of these things 6.085166479973199e-232
what's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden 7.631011170724675e-232
you've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner 1.5026351931293137e-232
and the last operation was to think about the cell the small cell of the project like the apartment as an essential part of the master plan 7.563850534008507e-156
the sun 1.2882297539194154e-231
my inner stripper was very strong and by yeah no by the first day of kindergarten i was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times 9.793569269297845e-233
and for doing such a big project the biggest project i've ever designed i really needed to understand the city of tunis but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture 2.63873835879709e-156
open your mouth as wide as possible until it's square 6.085166479973199e-232
and i founded maysoon's kids a charity that hopes to give palestinian refugee children a sliver of the chance my parents gave me 3.153082010153151e-156
i want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking 3.418291552750845e-232
nobody around to teach me fine 1.2882297539194154e-231
well we can do that for ourselves 1.0032743411283238e-231
the honest answer is i don't know 7.1958300848837144e-155
and if i really think about it on the basis of my own evidence i don't know the answer 3.294877163878425e-155
it pretty much flunks the bechdel test 8.853864984883467e-232
now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles 6.895396983435736e-232
it came to be known as the memory palace 8.853864984883467e-232
the nile used to flow right next to the city of itjtawy and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east it covered over the city 1.0327450581717792e-232
and it's well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the baker baker paradox which goes like this if i tell two people to remember the same word if i say to you remember that there is a guy named baker 4.585439703421259e-157
he cut my mom six different times in six different directions suffocating poor little me in the process 1.7434293862051595e-232
i might for example say that i certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher i know to teach the reception class to read but in no way to drive the school minibus 4.87834222988922e-233
and this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain 3.572910002197882e-156
they wear a uniform in many cities 1.0032743411283238e-231
we remember when we are deeply engaged 1.0032743411283238e-231
so how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape 8.853864984883467e-232
these two examples they have a common approach in the design process 6.085166479973199e-232
they've expanded and enriched our lives 1.258141043412406e-231
they are the first guardians of public health 8.853864984883467e-232
and it also reinforces this idea of the gates 6.333134513676991e-155
for this reason i see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people 2.033595594634579e-233
so one day i stayed a little late after school a little too late and i lurked in the girls' bathroom 8.594193461806229e-156
no itjtawy was here yet but we're going to be returning to the site in the near future to map it out 2.0732986305800918e-232
truly it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the sats 5.3701405702879534e-232
he was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship 1.5026351931293137e-232
they are tricks that work because they're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work 1.9755643120096232e-232
so our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this some new relationship with each other and i think we really have to show them and model for them how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them and wants to be on their team and stands up against the real bad guys who are the men who want to abuse the women 3.76395811745305e-158
another thing that's really unique about the wizard of oz to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female 1.1702534650797613e-232
are they competent are they honest are they reliable 1.2882297539194154e-231
same word different amount of remembering that's weird 8.853864984883467e-232
maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well 5.3701405702879534e-232
they are so easy to help 1.2882297539194154e-231
if so i haven't yet spotted it 4.364491568564534e-155
the person who was told his name is baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is that he is a baker 4.4080798132222975e-233
but my tiger mother said no 1.0032743411283238e-231
this is a guy called e p 1.1368587676511996e-231
the campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in who did they think would clean up after them 2.8744291130001147e-232
and i am still baffled by my behavior 1.1931009847695213e-231
a lot of people with c p don't walk but my parents didn't believe in can't 1.614686597036647e-232
you know when to expect them 1.0032743411283238e-231
i didn't get the part 1.5319719891192393e-231
i fiddled with my rival's grades just a little just demoted some of those a's 3.25715490284633e-232
famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply 4.182269681343779e-232
the bible is interesting but strange 1.2882297539194154e-231
i hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life 2.1863213053063146e-232
i've performed in clubs all over america and i've also performed in arabic in the middle east uncensored and uncovered 1.934650651088764e-232
so we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction 1.9755643120096232e-232
it suggests that you and i should rebuild trust 8.647068503442337e-232
the disabled are the largest yeah clap for that man c'mon 6.895396983435736e-232
so you have to i think be trustworthy 9.798412298238562e-232
but then it starts to sound like this my 20s are almost over and i have nothing to show for myself 1.5184890820812707e-155
what if jealousy really is a matter of geometry just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another 7.563850534008507e-156
last but not least emma believed that you can't pick your family but you can pick your friends 3.6144032579402e-232
the best time to work on your marriage is before you have one and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work 2.2386076440877334e-232
a lot of these systems have the converse effect 1.1368587676511996e-231
put a mouth inside the door asking questions 8.853864984883467e-232
i call these eight characters radicals 1.2882297539194154e-231
suddenly lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented 4.739132419722992e-232
he gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood 4.739132419722992e-232
i was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best i could hope for 2.1863213053063146e-232
now when i heard this i was so relieved 1.0032743411283238e-231
it was a lean-to on a bluff looking over a crystal beautiful lake when i discovered a horror 3.25715490284633e-232
today we started by talking about the boundary but if we remove this boundary the only boundary left is our imagination 1.7434293862051595e-232
we're proud of you 1.1368587676511996e-231
it is not important if i like the job or not 9.798412298238562e-232
is it something as obvious as that jealousy which boils down into person desire impediment is such a solid narrative foundation 1.9755643120096232e-232
now emma's story made that sound easy but that's what i love about working with twentysomethings 1.9755643120096232e-232
that's a perfectly rational thing 1.2882297539194154e-231
so there is a parochial explanation in silicon valley which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed intel microsoft apple and genentech 4.082567065460873e-233
we remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience and figure out why it is meaningful to us why it is significant why it's colorful when we're able to transform it in some way that it makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds when we're able to transform bakers into bakers 1.4731317078125302e-234
it's realizing you can't have that career you now want 4.973584861914399e-232
i also thought how to close the building 7.813508425061864e-232
when i was in the first grade the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes all expenses paid 2.5366747889215876e-232
this is advice that goes back 2 000-plus years to the earliest latin memory treatises 2.2386076440877334e-232
i was five years old and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a saturn v rocket 2.1922463925059615e-232
if my three older sisters went to public school my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that i went too and if we didn't all get a's we all got my mother's slipper 1.7018671523809808e-233
we won't go to mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on earth 1.7027087446182536e-232
he's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes money to send back home to his family 2.2386076440877334e-232
what i want to share with you today is how we've used satellite data to find an ancient egyptian city called itjtawy missing for thousands of years 6.263915414478913e-233
thank you 1.2882297539194154e-231
however overtime i got used to looking for them 7.236523273960503e-232
i knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week 9.331905037821599e-233
but as they work together something starts to change and finally in the adventure of the six napoleons once holmes comes in dazzles everybody with his solution lestrade turns to holmes and he says we're not jealous of you mr holmes 5.842138749916553e-234
yeah on broadway it's crazy 1.2882297539194154e-231
encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading 3.690840039559348e-232
person 1.2882297539194154e-231
it's not easy it is judgment and simple reaction attitudes don't do adequately here 2.6621681380487264e-232
one of the young men in the room was aden 7.813508425061864e-232
so if you know a foreign language it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages 1.4131133182782952e-155
for trying to map the past i knew that i had to see differently 5.244712163973215e-232
and it's north-south because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation 2.8072921250592275e-232
jealousy likes photos 1.2882297539194154e-231
she was a 26-year-old woman named alex 8.853864984883467e-232
thank you 1.2882297539194154e-231
it's a remarkable statistic 1.2882297539194154e-231
in the first volume swann's way the series of books swann one of the main characters is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed and suddenly in the course of a few sentences and these are proustian sentences so they're long as rivers but in the course of a few sentences he suddenly recoils and he realizes hang on everything i love about this woman somebody else would love about this woman 1.9936669692164374e-235
i also learned about the relentlessness of trash 1.2882297539194154e-231
my name is maysoon zayid and i am not drunk but the doctor who delivered me was 0.12547530994780284
thank you very much 1.2882297539194154e-231
do you know what i'm talking about 1.4256605770826504e-231
she is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of american letters 8.647068503442337e-232
i think there was a first-kiss moment when i really expected the credits to start rolling because that's the end of the movie right 1.1097567867507661e-232
but you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work right 3.690840039559348e-232
we've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep angst-ridden conversations in this hideout and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say are you coming to bed honey 2.4762020955350534e-233
three trees together we create the forest 1.2882297539194154e-231
the monkeys are rather aggressive as are the apple trees 8.853864984883467e-232
well frankly i think that's a stupid aim 9.798412298238562e-232
so i want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane 5.242119877384047e-233
what do these two have in common 1.2882297539194154e-231
these are just tricks 1.2882297539194154e-231
it empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking 3.25715490284633e-232
sherry brown got the part 1.2882297539194154e-231
and i really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions 1.9999360716992512e-78
but you know these shells they're hard to find 1.0032743411283238e-231
his memory was so bad that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem which is amazing 2.6621681380487264e-232
hello tedwomen what's up 1.2882297539194154e-231
i need you to actually see this 1.258141043412406e-231
now swann and proust we have to admit were notoriously jealous 8.647068503442337e-232
does the novel show us a way out i'm not sure 5.9430374753870144e-232
and he takes the relatives by the hand and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage 9.71217633369407e-156
as you can see the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world 4.082567065460873e-233
thank you very much 1.2882297539194154e-231
it must always be in motion 1.2882297539194154e-231
she was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said who's going to be there for me if i get in a car wreck 1.3260709036512249e-232
so over the next weeks and months i told emma three things that every twentysomething male or female deserves to hear 1.1702534650797613e-232
here in new york the department of sanitation cleans up after us to the tune of 11 000 tons of garbage and 2 000 tons of recyclables every day 1.1702534650797613e-232
but that's so unfair 1.2882297539194154e-231
in fact i don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy would we even have literature 1.2504477702495943e-155
what you're doing is you're trying to get better and better and better at creating at dreaming up these utterly ludicrous raunchy hilarious and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye 4.87834222988922e-233
in ancient china that means in exile because chinese emperors they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains 2.2386076440877334e-232
but if on the other hand they're unreliable we might not 4.973584861914399e-232
to me the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know how little science knows about building it 2.3594750978510907e-233
do you know britney spears 1.2882297539194154e-231
now there are 20 arabs in town and they are still all my family 4.084585940286461e-232
we think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea 6.085166479973199e-232
today i brought two recent projects as an example of this 7.631011170724675e-232
when the coast was clear i emerged crept into the classroom and took from my teacher's desk the grade book 9.138642588129591e-233
you know proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him 3.690840039559348e-232
how does dorothy win her movie 1.2882297539194154e-231
but how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead 5.9591435322538505e-232
but it is an irreproducible model for the future 1.0032743411283238e-231
you can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose 6.895396983435736e-232
so i wanted to end with my favorite quote from the middle kingdom it was probably written at the city of itjtawy four thousand years ago 2.477426605014895e-232
we should really pray for her 1.1368587676511996e-231
i'm not advocating capitalism i'm just pointing out their relationship 4.364491568564534e-155
and i don't think it should because a lot of the movie i don't know if you've seen it but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis 4.486253555180459e-80
a mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit 8.853864984883467e-232
they were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes 8.853864984883467e-232
so we collaborated with the egyptian scientists to do coring work which you see here 5.3701405702879534e-232
and i think our job in the netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the bechdel test if we can find them and to seek out the heroines who are there who show real courage who bring people together and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say i want to be on their team because they're going to be on their team 1.4203033774431842e-81
perhaps if there were more positive images it would foster less hate on the internet 4.182269681343779e-232
